    <h2 class="section-anchor">Welcome to my creative space</h2>
    <p>
      This part of the site is where I collect the more creative side of my work — a mix of narrative design, game mechanics, character creation, fiction writing, music, and whatever else captures my imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, I’ve written original one-shots and homebrew content for D&D 5e, exploring different themes, characters, and scenarios that often stretch beyond traditional archetypes. I enjoy building things that feel alive — whether it's a peculiar item with a hidden story or a dilemma woven into an adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond tabletop games, I spend time writing fiction across different genres, from fantasy settings to more introspective stories. I also play electric guitar, sketch out ideas for future projects, and read a lot — not just for inspiration, but as a way to reconnect with how stories take shape.

          <h4>Diana Maréehaute</h4>
          <p>
            Diana was my first character played in a long campaign (2 years). She is a <b>Halfling multiclass Blood Hunter 9/ Rogue 8</b> who was an all pourpuse fighter 
            (strong in both close and ranged combat) with no magic whatsoever which also led to quite a few problems for the party due to her recklessness and tendency to bite dying demons.

          <h4>Marlo Zeller</h4>
          <p>
            Marlo is my second important character that i created for a recently started campaign. He is a <b>Goblin multiclass Bard 2/Warlock 2</b> who is a fearful young man who tries hard to avoid violence and tries as best he can to defend the last.
            He has done little in his life except loiter, work his day job and play with his new banjo which, <b>for some reason</b>, has made him a suprisingly talented musician.

    <h2 class="section-anchor">Writing</h2>
    <p>I enjoy experimenting with fiction, both short stories and novel-length ideas. Some projects are private drafts, others may become sharable content soon.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="reading">
    <h2 class="section-anchor">Reading</h2>
    <p>I love reading despite the fact that I take long breaks (even months) between one book and another. I find reading (both in English and Italian) very engaging and stimulating especially when I find books that are unusual and alien to my interests or habits 
      that make me see narrative universes or ways of telling a story that I have never seen before. I list below my 5 favourite books (or series of books) in no particular order:</p>
      <ul class="reading-list">
        <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36140235-blackwater" target="_blank">Blackwater: The Complete Saga – Michael McDowell</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5129.Brave_New_World?ref=nav_sb_noss_l_7" target="_blank">Brave New World – Aldous Huxley</a></li>
