    <h2 class="section-anchor">Welcome to my creative space</h2>
    <p>
      This part of the site is dedicated to my creative side — a blend of narrative design, game mechanics, character building, fiction writing, music and anything else that lets ideas take shape in unexpected ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, I’ve written several original one-shots and custom mechanics for D&D 5e, exploring themes, scenarios, and characters that often go beyond classic archetypes. I find great joy in creating playable content that feels alive — whether it's a strange item with a backstory, or a moral dilemma woven into a dungeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      My experience as a Dungeon Master and player has also led me to build systems that prioritize immersion, emotional pacing, and flexible worldbuilding. Many of my game elements come from my love for storytelling and my curiosity for things I don’t fully understand — science, folklore, music, and psychology among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond tabletop games, I regularly write fiction across genres, from fantasy to introspective stories. I also enjoy playing electric guitar, designing ideas for future projects, and reading — not only as inspiration, but as a way to reconnect with the logic and rhythm of storytelling itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This space is not about perfection or performance — it's a quiet archive of what happens when imagination, structure, and curiosity are allowed to grow together.

    <h2 class="section-anchor">Dungeons & Dragons</h2>
    <p>
      I’ve been exploring the world of D&D 5e as both a player and Dungeon Master for several years, with a focus on narrative depth, worldbuilding and custom mechanics. This section showcases some of my creative work within that system.

    <!-- Characters -->
    <div class="dnd-subsection" id="dnd-characters">
      <h3><span class="icon">🧝‍♂️</span> Characters</h3>
      <p>Original characters I've designed or played, each with their own narrative arc, class balance, and sometimes questionable decisions.</p>

      <h3><span class="icon">📜</span> One-Shots</h3>
      <p>Short adventures crafted for quick, engaging sessions. Each one-shot has a theme, tone, and twist — designed to work in a single session.</p>
  
      <ul class="oneshot-list">
        <li><span class="icon">🎲</span> <strong>Whispers in the Fog</strong> – horror/mystery, 3–4 hours</li>

  <section id="writing">
    <h2 class="section-anchor">Writing</h2>
    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy writing fiction in a variety of genres — from speculative short stories to fantasy-inspired worldbuilding. Some ideas start as settings for games, others grow into personal narratives or experimental texts.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="reading">
    <h2 class="section-anchor">Reading</h2>
    <p>Reading is one of the things that inspires my creative work the most — whether it's science fiction, essays, or folklore. It shapes the way I imagine characters, structures stories, and builds worlds both playful and introspective.</p>
